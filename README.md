# store-passing

I have the complete skeleton from my project including a complete definition of CBPV from the writeup. For my safety goal, I simply want a state passing transformation and to push forward the pset 9 proofs for fibonacci in it. This is difficult for me as I have no clue what the compile means. I have done a little reading on Agda modules and records, but I am not sure what the compile function is doing.

For the target goal, the first thing I need to do is define compile the other direction. This is needed so I can get a to and a from function and show that to-from is equal to no translation. My goal is to fix the type error between the two modules and fill in the fur goals to show the isomorphism between the two languages.
